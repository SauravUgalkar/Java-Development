# Core Java Console Applications Suite

## 📄 Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of four distinct console-based applications developed using **Core Java**. These projects demonstrate a strong command of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Data Structures (Collections Framework)**, **Multi-threading**, and **Algorithm Design**.

Each module simulates a real-world system, focusing on backend logic, state management, and user interaction without the need for a graphical interface.


### 1. Banking System Simulation

A functional financial transaction interface designed to replicate ATM operations.

* **Key Features:** Secure user authentication (Login), real-time balance inquiry, and validated deposit/withdrawal processing.
* **Logic:** Implements robust error handling to prevent overdrafts and negative balance errors.

### 2. E-Commerce Shopping Cart

A dynamic inventory and checkout system simulating an online shopping experience.

* **Key Features:** Allows users to browse products, modify cart quantities, and process checkouts.
* **Logic:** Features a persistent "Purchase History" log using `ArrayList` to track transactions within a session.

### 3. Timed Examination Portal

A multi-threaded assessment tool designed to enforce strict time limits on users.

* **Key Features:** Automated score calculation, question bank management, and immediate result generation.
* **Tech Highlight:** Utilizes **Java Multi-threading (`Thread` class)** to run a countdown timer concurrently with the main user interface thread.

### 4. Digital Library Management

A resource allocation system that manages relationships between users (Students) and assets (Books).

* **Key Features:** Book borrowing and returning workflows, search functionality, and stock tracking.
* **Logic:** Manages data association, ensuring that global inventory updates automatically when specific users borrow items.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Concepts Used

* **Language:** Java (JDK 1.8+)
* **Core Concepts:** OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
* **Data Structures:** Java Collections Framework (`ArrayList`, `List`)
* **Concurrency:** Multi-threading (`Thread`, `run()`, `sleep()`)
* **Input Handling:** `java.util.Scanner` for interactive CLI menus.
* **Logic Control:** Complex Switch-Case menus and Loop structures.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Integration of **File Handling** (I/O) to make data persistent across sessions.
* Implementation of **JDBC** for database connectivity (MySQL).
* Migration of the interface to **JavaFX** or **Spring Boot** for web deployment.
